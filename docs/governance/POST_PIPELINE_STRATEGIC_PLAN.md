# ADAAD Post-Pipeline Strategic Plan
## v9.55.0 — Phase 122 Complete — 36 Innovations Shipped

**Document authority:** HUMAN-0 (Dustin L. Reid, Governor, Innovative AI LLC)  
**Effective date:** 2026-04-04  
**Status:** Active — supersedes all prior directional notes  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Constitutional principle:** Every item in this plan must be ratified by HUMAN-0 before Track A execution begins. Plans describe intent; governance governs execution.

---

## Executive Summary

ADAAD has completed its foundational 36-innovation pipeline across Phases 87–122, culminating in VERIFIABLE_CLAIMS + README Credibility at v9.55.0 with **162 Hard-class constitutional invariants** enforced across the system.

The pipeline completion marks a strategic inflection point. The question is no longer *what to build* — it is *how to make what was built verifiable, adoptable, and commercially legible* to the outside world.

This plan addresses four strategic priorities in sequence:

1. **Verifiability** — Make ADAAD independently auditable by any third party in under 10 minutes.
2. **Credibility** — Replace marketing language with reproducible claims and external validation.
3. **Adoptability** — Lower the barrier from "research artifact" to "tool people can run."
4. **Sustainability** — Establish community governance, distribution infrastructure, and commercial readiness.

These priorities are ordered by dependency. Verifiability enables credibility. Credibility enables adoption. Adoption enables sustainability.

## Part I — Current State Assessment

### 1.1 What Was Built

| Dimension | Current State |
|-----------|--------------|
| Core version | v9.53.0 |
| Hard-class invariants | 155 |
| Innovation modules | 35 shipped across `runtime/innovations30/` |
| Phases completed | 120 |
| Test coverage | 30/30 acceptance tests per phase (verified) |
| PyPI distribution | v9.50.0 (published) |
| MCP server | Running on port 8091, JWT-authenticated |
| Evidence artifacts | Present in `artifacts/governance/` per phase |
| Governance ledger | HMAC-chained JSONL, append-only |
| Constitutional loop | CEL 14-step wired, deterministic replay |
| SPIE | System proposes its own next innovations; HUMAN-0 ratifies |

### 1.2 What Is Missing (Gap Analysis)

The following gaps were identified through the attached external strategic analysis and internal audit:

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| No `docker-compose.yml` or one-command demo | Third parties cannot observe the system without deep setup | P0 |
| No standalone ledger verifier | Cryptographic claims are unverifiable without codebase knowledge | P0 |
| README contains unsubstantiated "world-first" claims | Triggers skepticism; reduces credibility with technical audiences | P0 |
| ROADMAP stale (references v9.48.0 as current) | Governance documentation drift undermines audit integrity | P1 |
| No `adaad-core` extracted as importable kernel | Cannot adopt individual subsystems without full stack | P1 |
| No `VERIFIABLE_CLAIMS.md` | No traceable link from claims to test evidence | P1 |
| No public benchmark baseline | Innovation comparisons cannot be reproduced by external parties | P2 |
| Community governance not open | Constitutional amendments are a solo process | P2 |
| Name collision with CVPR 2023 AdaAD | Reduces search discoverability | P3 |
| No "Break It" red-team challenge | No external stress-test of the 155 invariants | P3 |

### 1.3 Open GA Blockers

| ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|----|-------|----------|--------|
| FINDING-66-004 | Governance Key Ceremony: 2-of-3 Ed25519 threshold not executed | P2 | Runbook delivered; ceremony deferred |

All other findings resolved. v1.1-GA gate is single-item: FINDING-66-004.

---

## Part II — Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1 — Verifiability

**Problem:** ADAAD's cryptographic evolution proof DAG, append-only governance ledger, and constitutional invariant enforcement are entirely self-reported. An external observer reading the README cannot verify a single claim in under an hour.

**Target state:** Any technically competent observer can independently verify one concrete ADAAD claim in under 10 minutes, using only publicly available tools and the ADAAD repository.

#### Deliverable 1.1 — Docker Demo Sandbox

**Branch:** `feat/demo-sandbox`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)  
**Target release:** v9.54.0

A `docker-compose.yml` that launches a self-contained ADAAD instance with:
- Pre-loaded toy constitution (5 rules, no external dependencies)
- Simulated mutation cycle (3 candidate mutations, deterministic seed)
- Ledger output visible in container stdout
- Governance gate evaluation logged step-by-step
- CEL dry-run completing without external API calls

Acceptance criteria:
- `docker compose up` produces a complete mutation cycle in under 3 minutes on a cold machine
- Ledger output includes: epoch_id, gate verdict, fitness scores, HMAC chain
- No API keys required (fallback to DorkEngine deterministic mode)
- `DEMO.md` documents every step with expected output

#### Deliverable 1.2 — Standalone Ledger Verifier

**Branch:** `feat/demo-sandbox`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)  
**File:** `scripts/verify_ledger.py`

A zero-dependency Python script (stdlib only) that:
- Accepts any ADAAD governance ledger JSONL file as input
- Reconstructs the HMAC chain from the genesis hash
- Reports: total records, chain integrity (pass/fail), epoch coverage, any tampered records
- Exits 0 on clean, exits 1 on any integrity failure

Usage: `python verify_ledger.py artifacts/governance/phase120/evidence.jsonl`

This makes the CEPD (Phase 90) and HMAC-chain claims independently verifiable by any third party.

#### Deliverable 1.3 — Epoch Replay Proof Script

**Branch:** `feat/demo-sandbox`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)  
**File:** `scripts/replay_epoch.py`

Replays a specific epoch from ledger state alone and confirms bit-identical output against the stored replay digest. Demonstrates the determinism claim without requiring any ADAAD internals knowledge.

---

### Priority 2 — Credibility

**Problem:** The README and CHANGELOG contain phrases like "world-first" and "world's first" for capabilities that have no published baseline comparison. These trigger skepticism in the technical audiences ADAAD needs to reach.

**Target state:** Every claim in the README maps to a measurable, reproducible evidence point. Marketing language is replaced with engineering language.

#### Deliverable 2.1 — README Rewrite

**Branch:** `feat/readme-credibility`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)  
**Target release:** v9.55.0

Restructure README:
1. **What it is** (2 paragraphs, no claims, no superlatives): governed autonomous software evolution engine with constitutional enforcement
2. **Quick start** (4 commands to running demo)
3. **Measurable properties** (table): invariant count, test coverage, phase count, PyPI version, ledger record count from Phase 120 epoch
4. **Architecture** (existing diagram, cleaned)
5. **How governance works** (existing CEL description, kept)
6. **Technical reference** (links to existing docs)

Remove all instances of "world-first" unless a peer-reviewed citation or reproducible benchmark comparison is provided.

#### Deliverable 2.2 — VERIFIABLE_CLAIMS.md

**Branch:** `feat/readme-credibility`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)  
**File:** `docs/VERIFIABLE_CLAIMS.md`

A structured document listing:
- Each major ADAAD claim
- The specific module(s) implementing it
- The test file(s) verifying it
- The governance artifact evidencing it
- How to reproduce the verification

Example row:
```
| Claim | Append-only ledger with tamper detection |
| Module | runtime/innovations30/invariant_discovery.py |
| Tests | tests/test_phase116_ide.py (30/30) |
| Evidence | artifacts/governance/phase116/phase116_sign_off.json |
| Verify | python scripts/verify_ledger.py <path> → exit 0 |
```

#### Deliverable 2.3 — ROADMAP Synchronization

**Branch:** `feat/readme-credibility`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)

Update ROADMAP.md:
- Set current version to v9.53.0 (was v9.48.0)
- Add Phase 116–120 entries (INNOV-31 through INNOV-35)
- Update hard invariant count to 155
- Correct GA blocker to FINDING-66-004 only
- Add post-pipeline horizon section (this plan)
- Update summary table to include all shipped phases through Phase 120

---

### Priority 3 — Adoptability

**Problem:** ADAAD is structurally a monolith. Adoption requires importing the entire stack. There is no CLI entry point. There is no minimal surface an external developer can experiment with.

**Target state:** A developer can install `adaad-core` from PyPI and use the constitutional governance kernel independently of the full evolution stack. A CLI provides three commands covering the primary user journeys.

#### Deliverable 3.1 — ADAAD CLI Entry Point

**Branch:** `feat/adaad-cli`  
**Track:** A (Claude executes)  
**Target release:** v9.56.0  
**File:** `adaad/__main__.py` + `scripts/adaad`

Three commands:

```bash
adaad demo                         # Runs the Docker demo inline (no Docker required, uses DorkEngine fallback)
adaad inspect-ledger <path>        # Wraps verify_ledger.py with human-readable output
adaad propose "<description>"      # Submits a mutation proposal to the local evolution loop
```

All commands respect `ADAAD_SANDBOX_ONLY=true` by default. No live system writes without explicit operator opt-in.

#### Deliverable 3.2 — adaad-core Extraction Specification

**Branch:** `feat/adaad-core-extract`  
**Track:** A (Plan + skeleton) / B (Package publication — Dustin)  
**Target release:** v9.57.0

Extract the constitutional governance kernel as a lightweight, separately installable package:

**Package:** `adaad-core`  
**Contents:**
- `GovernanceGate` (sole mutation approval surface)
- `ConstitutionalRollbackEngine` (INNOV-32 CRTV)
- `InvariantDiscoveryEngine` (INNOV-31 IDE)
- `MirrorTest` (INNOV-30 MIRROR)
- `EpochMemoryStore` (Phase 52)
- `LedgerVerifier` (new, from Deliverable 1.2)
- Constitutional invariant registry

**Not included in adaad-core:**
- Full evolution loop
- SPIE / federation modules
- UI (Aponi / Dork / Whaledic)
- Android distribution
- MCP server

**API surface (stable, semver-governed):**
```python
from adaad_core import GovernanceGate, ConstitutionalRollbackEngine, verify_ledger
```

**Rationale:** If someone wants to adopt only the adversarial gate or the ledger verifier, they should not need to import the entire ADAAD stack.

#### Deliverable 3.3 — Onboarding Documentation

**Branch:** `feat/readme-credibility`  
**Track:** A  

Two new docs:
- `QUICKSTART.md` — 5-minute path from zero to running demo
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — module map, layer diagram, governance data flow

---

### Priority 4 — Sustainability

**Problem:** ADAAD is currently a solo-authored system with no external review, no community governance, and distribution limited to PyPI and GitHub Releases. Long-term viability requires external validation and a path to community participation.

#### Deliverable 4.1 — Academic/Conference Submission Spec

**Track:** B (Dustin authors and submits)  
**Timeline:** Q3 2026

Candidate venues for a short paper focused on one innovation (recommended: AFRT — Adversarial Fitness Red Team, INNOV-08):
- ICSE 2027 (Software Engineering AI track) — abstract deadline typically September
- NeurIPS 2026 ML Safety workshop — deadline typically August
- AAAI 2027 AI Governance track

Paper scope: the AFRT red-team gate only (Phase 92). One focused claim, reproducible benchmark, no "world-first" framing. Target: independent peer review of one ADAAD primitive.

Prerequisite: Docker demo (Deliverable 1.1) must be submitted as a reproducible artifact.

#### Deliverable 4.2 — Community Constitution Amendment Process

**Branch:** `feat/community-governance`  
**Track:** A (infrastructure) / B (ratification)  
**Target:** v9.58.0

Open the constitutional amendment process to community pull requests:
- `CONSTITUTION_PROPOSALS.md` — proposal template
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/constitution_amendment.md` — structured PR template
- Amendment workflow: PR → CI validation → HUMAN-0 review → FGCON quorum (using Phase 119 FGCON module) → GPG-signed ratification

**Invariant preserved:** FGCON-QUORUM-0 — no single instance (or contributor) can ratify a federation-level amendment unilaterally. HUMAN-0 ratification remains architecturally inviolable.

This turns "constitutional self-amendment" from a solo feature into a real social process, as recommended in the external strategic analysis.

#### Deliverable 4.3 — "Break It" Challenge

**Branch:** `feat/break-it-challenge`  
**Track:** A (infrastructure) / B (announcement)  
**Target:** v9.59.0

Public red-team challenge:
- `docs/BREAK_IT_CHALLENGE.md` — rules, scope, submission format, recognition
- Challenge scope: bypass any of the 155 Hard-class invariants OR produce a tampered ledger that passes `verify_ledger.py`
- Recognition: named in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, permanent credit in CHANGELOG
- Submission: GitHub Issue with `break-it` label
- All attempts (successful or not) published in `docs/break_it_log/`

**Constitutional guarantee:** Every invariant violation found through this process is a finding, tracked to resolution, with no suppression of unsuccessful bypass attempts.

#### Deliverable 4.4 — v1.1-GA Release Gate Closure

**Track:** B (Dustin)  
**Blocker:** FINDING-66-004

The single remaining GA blocker is the Governance Key Ceremony (2-of-3 Ed25519 threshold). Runbook is delivered at `docs/runbooks/governance_key_ceremony.md`. Execution is deferred to Dustin on ADAADell.

Upon ceremony completion:
- `governance/key_ceremony_attestation.json` is produced
- FINDING-66-004 status → resolved
- v1.1-GA tag is eligible for GPG signing and release

**Track B — Dustin on ADAADell:**

```bash
# Step 1: Execute key ceremony per runbook
cat docs/runbooks/governance_key_ceremony.md

# Step 2: Produce attestation
# (per runbook — generates governance/key_ceremony_attestation.json)

# Step 3: Tag GA release
git tag -s v1.1.0-GA -m "v1.1-GA: FINDING-66-004 resolved; key ceremony complete"
git push origin v1.1.0-GA
```

---

## Part IV — Post-GA Horizon (v9.60.0+)

The following items are scoped for the post-v1.1-GA horizon. They are not blocked pending GA, but they are lower priority than the verifiability/credibility arc.

### Academic Submission (Deliverable 4.1)

Submit a single-innovation paper (AFRT recommended) to ICSE 2027 or NeurIPS 2026 ML Safety. Prerequisite: Docker demo available as reproducible artifact.

### External Integration SDK

An `adaad-sdk` package providing:
- Typed Python client for the Aponi REST API
- Webhook integration for external CI/CD pipelines
- Governance event stream consumer

### Operator Dashboard Public Beta

Make the Aponi governance health dashboard publicly accessible (read-only, unauthenticated) for a designated demo epoch, to demonstrate the live governance health signal in operation.

### Name Disambiguation

Add a prominent disambiguation footnote to the README: "Not to be confused with the CVPR 2023 AdaAD (Adaptive Adversarial Distillation) paper or the French home care association." No rebranding required; disambiguation is sufficient.

---

## Part V — Governance Invariants for This Plan

The following invariants apply to the execution of this plan itself:

| ID | Invariant |
|----|-----------|
| PLAN-HUMAN-0 | No phase from this plan opens an implementation PR without HUMAN-0 ratification of that specific phase |
| PLAN-TRACK-0 | Track A and Track B boundaries are inviolable. Claude executes Track A. Dustin executes Track B. |
| PLAN-CLAIM-0 | README rewrite must not introduce new unsubstantiated claims. Every claim maps to a test file. |
| PLAN-LEDGER-0 | `verify_ledger.py` must be tested against a known-good and known-tampered ledger in CI before merge |
| PLAN-GATE-0 | v1.1-GA tag requires FINDING-66-004 closure. No GA tag without key ceremony attestation. |
| PLAN-CORE-0 | `adaad-core` API surface is semver-governed from first PyPI publication. No breaking changes without major bump. |

---
