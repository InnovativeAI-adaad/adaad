## Abstract

A system and method for autonomous software mutation under constitutional governance, wherein all code change proposals are evaluated against a set of constitutional rules before execution, with cryptographic evidence generated at each decision point for deterministic replay verification. The system achieves autonomous code evolution while maintaining audit-grade accountability through an append-only hash-chained ledger and fail-closed governance gates.

## Novel Claims Summary

### Claim 1 — Constitutional Evolution Loop (CEL)

A method for governing autonomous software mutation comprising:

1. A **fixed-order pipeline** of exactly N steps (N=14 in the preferred embodiment), wherein each step must complete successfully before the next begins, and any failure causes immediate halt with zero silent errors (invariant CEL-ORDER-0)
2. A **determinism verification step** preceding all mutation evaluation, wherein the CodeIntelModel must confirm `determinism_verified=True` before any proposal is processed
3. A **replay verification step** wherein a hash of the mutated code must exactly match a recorded baseline hash; any divergence triggers automatic rollback (invariant SANDBOX-DIV-0)
4. A **cryptographic evidence step** wherein each epoch produces a hash-chained ledger entry linked to its predecessor via SHA-256, creating a tamper-evident record of every governance decision

### Claim 2 — Fail-Closed Constitutional Gate

A governance gate system wherein:

1. A set of constitutional rules is organized by severity: BLOCKING (unconditional rejection), WARNING (flagged continuation), ADVISORY (informational)
2. **BLOCKING rules cannot be overridden** by any mutation, configuration, or runtime flag — they are enforced at the code level, not merely at the policy level (invariant GOV-SOLE-0)
3. The gate produces a deterministic binary outcome for any given input, enabling byte-identical replay of all historical governance decisions
4. A **single approval surface** exists — no mutation may be applied through any path that bypasses this gate

### Claim 3 — Multi-Signal Fitness Scoring with Adaptive Weights

A mutation evaluation system comprising:

1. A composite fitness score computed from **N independent bounded signals** (N=7 in the preferred embodiment), each with weight bounds [0.05, 0.70] to prevent any single signal from dominating
2. An **unconditional veto signal** (determinism divergence) that is not scored but immediately rejects any mutation where replay divergence is detected (invariant FIT-DIV-0)
3. An **adaptive weight system** using EMA momentum descent (LR=0.05) that adjusts signal weights based on post-merge telemetry
4. A **non-stationarity detector** (Page-Hinkley sequential detection) that triggers alternative selection strategies (Thompson Sampling) after detecting reward signal drift

### Claim 4 — Hash-Chained Governance Ledger

An append-only audit ledger wherein:

1. Each entry contains the SHA-256 hash of the previous entry, making any tampering immediately detectable
2. All ledger entries are **deterministically replayable**: given the same inputs, the governance system produces byte-identical decisions
3. Replay divergence (any deviation from the recorded decision) triggers an immediate halt and alert before any mutation is applied
4. The ledger is **append-only** — no entry can be modified or deleted without breaking the hash chain

### Claim 5 — Tiered Mutation Authority with Blast Radius Control

A mutation authority system comprising:

1. **Tier 0 (Production)**: designated paths (runtime/, security/, app/main.py) that can never be autonomously mutated — human review is required
2. **Tier 1 (Stable)**: paths that may be auto-mutated with audit trail, subject to human review within 24 hours and automatic rollback on failure
3. **Tier 2 (Sandbox)**: isolated paths (app/agents/test_subject/) with full autonomous mutation authority and zero blast radius to other tiers
4. **Cross-tier mutation requires dual-gate approval** in both source and destination repositories (federation invariant)

### Claim 6 — Competing Agent Population with Bandit Selection

A mutation proposal system comprising:

1. **Multiple LLM-backed agents** (Architect, Dream, Beast in the preferred embodiment) that independently generate mutation proposals using different strategic approaches
2. **Population-based candidate competition** using BLX-alpha genetic crossover and MD5 deduplication, with up to N candidates per epoch (N=12 in the preferred embodiment)
3. **Bandit-based selection** using UCB1 algorithm with Thompson Sampling fallback, switching on non-stationarity detection
4. The best-scoring proposal that clears all constitutional rules is applied; all others are quarantined with full evidence

### Claim 7 — Federation with Dual-Gate Cross-Repository Governance

A federated mutation governance system wherein:

1. Cross-repository mutations require GovernanceGate approval in **both** source and destination repositories — failure in either gate blocks the mutation
2. Federation messages carry HMAC signatures verified against a trusted key registry — messages with unknown key_ids are rejected fail-closed
3. A FederatedEvidenceMatrix requires zero divergence across all federated nodes before any promotion
4. Lineage entries carry a `federation_origin` field linking each mutation to its source-repo epoch chain

## Differentiation from Prior Art

| Characteristic | Prior Art (LLM code tools) | ADAAD |
|---|---|---|
| Mutation approval | Suggest → human applies | Constitutional gate — autonomous with audit |
| Memory between sessions | None | Hash-chained lineage ledger, epoch by epoch |
| Audit trail | None | SHA-256 chain, deterministically replayable |
| Safety mechanism | Human is the safety layer | Constitutional governance IS the safety layer |
| Proof of decision | Cannot prove what happened | Every decision cryptographically evidenced |
| Deployment cost | Server-only, enterprise-priced | Runs on \$200 Android phone, Apache 2.0 |
| Self-improvement | N/A | Governed autonomous self-evolution (Phase 65) |

- **Hash-Chained Ledger**: `runtime/evolution/lineage_v2.py`
- **Replay Attestation**: `runtime/evolution/replay_attestation.py`
- **Fitness Engine V2**: `runtime/evolution/fitness_v2.py`
- **Adaptive Weights**: `runtime/autonomy/weight_adaptor.py`
- **Bandit Selector**: `runtime/autonomy/bandit_selector.py`
- **Federation Broker**: `runtime/governance/federation/mutation_broker.py`
- **Constitutional Rules**: `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` (v0.9.0, 23 rules)

## Notes for IP Counsel

1. The **CEL fixed-order pipeline** (Claim 1) and **single approval surface** (Claim 2, GOV-SOLE-0) are the strongest novel claims — no comparable system enforces a non-bypassable constitutional gate at the code level rather than policy level.

2. The **deterministic replay proof** (Claim 4) is particularly valuable in regulated verticals: the ability to cryptographically prove that a governance decision was made deterministically, and to re-run it later with identical results, has direct applicability to FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SOX, and FedRAMP requirements.

3. The **competing agent population** (Claim 6) is likely the most commercially visible novel aspect — it is the mechanism by which ADAAD achieves genuine autonomous improvement rather than simple suggestion.

4. Prior art search should focus on: autonomous code generation systems (Copilot, Cursor, Devin), ML pipeline governance systems, formal verification systems, and audit trail systems for financial software. None of these systems combine constitutional non-bypassable governance with autonomous mutation and cryptographic replay proof.

5. Patent priority date: ADAAD Phase 1 (Q4 2025) — first implementation of the constitutional gate and hash-chained ledger.
