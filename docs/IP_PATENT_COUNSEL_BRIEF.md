**To:** Patent Counsel (to be assigned)
**From:** Dustin L. Reid, Founder & CEO, Innovative AI LLC
**Date:** March 20, 2026
**Re:** Provisional Patent Application — Constitutional Autonomous Code Evolution System
**Finding Reference:** H-03 (FINDING-66-003)
**Priority:** HIGH — Time-sensitive; open-source repository is public

---

## Engagement Summary

Innovative AI LLC requests preparation and filing of a **provisional patent application** covering the Constitutional Mutation Governance Method implemented in the ADAAD system. The ADAAD repository is currently public (Apache-2.0) at `github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/ADAAD`. A provisional application must be filed promptly to establish priority date.

## Subject Matter Overview

ADAAD is a constitutionally governed autonomous code evolution engine. The system enables software to improve itself — generating, evaluating, and applying code mutations — while maintaining cryptographic audit accountability at every decision point. The patentable subject matter involves the **governance architecture** that makes this autonomy trustworthy, not the AI capabilities themselves.

## Five Core Patent Claims

### Claim 1 — Constitutional Evolution Loop (CEL)

A method for governing autonomous software mutation comprising a fixed-order pipeline of exactly N sequential steps (N=14 in preferred embodiment), wherein:
- Each step must complete successfully before the next begins
- Any step failure causes immediate halt with zero silent errors
- A determinism verification step precedes all mutation evaluation
- A replay verification step compares hash of mutated code against recorded baseline
- Divergence from baseline triggers automatic rollback
- Each epoch produces a hash-chained ledger entry linked via SHA-256

**Novelty argument:** No prior art establishes a fixed-order, fail-closed N-step pipeline with mandatory determinism verification and cryptographic replay linkage as prerequisites to autonomous code mutation.

---

### Claim 2 — Fail-Closed Constitutional Gate

A governance gate system wherein:
- Constitutional rules are organized by severity: BLOCKING (unconditional rejection), WARNING, ADVISORY
- BLOCKING rules are enforced at the **code level**, not policy level — no runtime flag, configuration, or mutation can override them
- The gate produces a deterministic binary outcome for any given input
- A single approval surface exists — no mutation path bypasses this gate

**Novelty argument:** Industry-standard AI code generation systems use policy-level safety filters that can be overridden by configuration or prompt injection. The fail-closed code-level enforcement model is architecturally distinct and novel.

---

### Claim 3 — Multi-Signal Fitness Scoring with Adaptive Weights

A mutation evaluation system comprising:
- N independent bounded signals (N=7 in preferred embodiment) with weight bounds [0.05, 0.70]
- An unconditional veto signal (determinism divergence) that rejects regardless of fitness score
- Adaptive weight system using EMA momentum descent (LR=0.05) adjusting weights based on post-merge telemetry
- Non-stationarity detector (Page-Hinkley sequential detection) triggering alternative selection at reward signal drift

**Novelty argument:** The unconditional veto signal that operates outside the scoring system, combined with adaptive weight bounds and drift detection, constitutes a novel composite evaluation architecture.

---

### Claim 4 — Hash-Chained Governance Ledger

An append-only audit ledger wherein:
- Each entry contains SHA-256 hash of the previous entry
- All entries are deterministically replayable — identical inputs produce byte-identical decisions
- Replay divergence triggers immediate halt before any mutation is applied
- The ledger is append-only — no entry can be modified without breaking the hash chain

**Novelty argument:** Application of blockchain-style hash chaining specifically to AI governance decision records, with mandatory halt-on-divergence enforcement, is novel in the autonomous code evolution domain.

---

### Claim 5 — Tiered Mutation Authority with Blast Radius Control

A mutation authority system comprising:
- Tier 0 (Production): designated paths that can never be autonomously mutated — human review mandatory
- Tier 1 (Stable): post-approval autonomous mutation with test coverage requirement
- Tier 2 (Experimental): autonomous mutation with sandbox isolation
- Blast radius quantification: each proposed mutation assigned a blast radius score before evaluation

**Novelty argument:** Formal path-based tiered authority with mathematical blast radius scoring as a governance gate input is novel in autonomous software development systems.

## Prior Art Considerations

| Area | Notes |
|---|---|
| OpenAI Codex / GitHub Copilot | Code generation — no governance architecture |
| Devin (Cognition Labs) | Autonomous coding agent — no constitutional gate or audit ledger |
| Traditional CI/CD | Pipeline execution — no constitutional evaluation of mutations |
| Blockchain / distributed ledgers | Hash chaining — no application to AI mutation governance |
| Genetic algorithms | Population-based optimization — no constitutional gate or human-tier authority |

## Requested Actions

1. **Provisional application filing** — establish priority date immediately
2. **Claims review** — refine the five core claims above against prior art search
3. **International filing strategy** — PCT consideration for enterprise market coverage
4. **Trademark coordination** — confirm ADAAD™, Aponi™, Cryovant™ registration status
5. **Trade secret delineation** — identify any subject matter better protected as trade secret vs. patent

---

## Timeline & Urgency

The ADAAD repository has been public since Phase 65 (early 2026). The one-year statutory bar for US provisional filing is approaching for the earliest published embodiments. **Filing should occur within 30 days of this brief.**
