## The Standard We're Beating

Current state-of-the-art AI loops: propose → evaluate → deploy → repeat. No memory of why decisions were made. No constitutional constraints. No cryptographic proof anything happened. No governance. No human override architecture. Just a gradient descent with a deploy button.

These 30 innovations make ADAAD categorically different — not just better, but operating in a dimension those systems can't reach.

---

## Category I — Constitutional Intelligence

### 1. Invariant Discovery Engine

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 87, v9.18.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase83/track_a_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase83/track_a_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md#phase-87-to-90-shipped-innovation-closure) · Claims: [`phase87-innov01-csap-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A subsystem that watches failed mutations, finds the failure patterns, and *proposes new constitutional rules* to prevent that class of failure permanently.

Right now, constitutional rules are written by humans during phase planning. This flips it: when the `FailurePatternMiner` detects that a specific mutation pattern fails governance 80% of the time, it generates a draft rule — formally structured in the existing `constitution.yaml` format — and submits it as an amendment proposal through the `HUMAN-0` gate.

The system discovers its own laws from its own failure history. Nothing like this exists anywhere.

**Constitutional anchor:** Extends `HUMAN-0` — the discovered rule still requires human ratification, but the system does the discovery.

**Why it's novel:** Every other AI safety approach requires humans to think of the rules first. This reverses the epistemology: the system shows you which rules it needs.

---

### 2. Constitutional Tension Resolver

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 87, v9.19.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase84/track_a_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase84/track_a_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md#phase-87-to-90-shipped-innovation-closure) · Claims: [`phase87-innov02-acse-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A reasoning engine that detects when two active constitutional rules produce contradictory verdicts on the same mutation, and escalates the contradiction as a first-class governance event rather than silently letting one rule win.

Currently if `rule_A` blocks a mutation and `rule_B` would pass it, the blocking rule wins. That's correct behavior. But the contradiction — two rules that disagree — is never recorded, never analyzed, never resolved. Over time this creates constitutional drift where some rules effectively become dead letters because they're always overridden.

The Tension Resolver maintains a `ConstitutionalTensionLedger`: every time two rules disagree on the same mutation, the disagreement is recorded with the full mutation context. When any rule has been consistently overridden by another rule for 20+ epochs, the Resolver proposes a constitutional amendment to either resolve the tension explicitly or retire the weaker rule.

**Why it's novel:** Constitutional law theory applied to software governance. Legislatures have parliamentary procedure for resolving conflicting statutes. ADAAD would be the first autonomous system to do this for its own rules.

---

### 3. Graduated Invariant Promotion

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 87, v9.20.0 · Closure: [docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md#phase-87-to-90-shipped-innovation-closure) · Claims: [`phase87-innov03-tife-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A lifecycle for constitutional invariants that mirrors the mutation lifecycle. Rules start as `advisory`, graduate to `warning`, and eventually earn `blocking` status — based on how many times they've fired correctly versus how many false positives they've produced.

A new constitutional rule that blocks too many good mutations gets automatically demoted back to `advisory` pending human review. A rule that has a perfect precision record over 50 epochs gets promoted to `blocking` automatically.

The constitution evolves its own enforcement strength based on empirical evidence about whether each rule is actually catching real problems or just generating noise.

**Why it's novel:** No constitutional framework anywhere has automatic rule strength calibration. Rules are written as absolutes. ADAAD would treat them as hypotheses that get stronger or weaker based on evidence.

---

### 4. Intent Preservation Verifier

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 88, v9.21.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase88/phase88_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase88/phase88_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md#phase-87-to-90-shipped-innovation-closure) · Claims: [`phase88-innov04-scdd-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A subsystem that, given a mutation proposal and the `intent` field that described what the proposer wanted to achieve, verifies *after mutation* whether the intent was actually realized.

Currently the `intent` field on `MutationRequest` is recorded and forgotten. The fitness engine measures what changed, not whether what changed matches what was intended. A mutation that sets out to "improve throughput" but actually "reduces complexity with no throughput change" passes all current gates.

The Intent Preservation Verifier runs post-mutation: it reads the original `intent`, reads the `SemanticDiffEngine` output of what actually changed, and computes an `intent_realization_score` between 0 and 1. Mutations with persistent low intent realization — where the proposer consistently says one thing and does another — flag the proposing agent for calibration.

**Why it's novel:** Semantic gap measurement between stated purpose and actual action. This is the software equivalent of holding agents accountable to what they said they were trying to do.

---

## Category II — Fitness Beyond Correctness

### 5. Temporal Regret Scorer

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 89, v9.22.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase89/phase89_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase89/phase89_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](docs/governance/V1_GA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md#phase-87-to-90-shipped-innovation-closure) · Claims: [`phase89-innov05-aoep-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A fitness signal that measures not how good a mutation looked at the time, but how good it still looks N epochs later.

Every mutation that was accepted gets a `regret_score` computed at epoch+10, epoch+25, and epoch+50: the difference between its predicted fitness impact at acceptance time and its measured fitness contribution at that later epoch. A mutation that looked great and stayed great has regret=0. A mutation that looked great but degraded the system over time has high regret.

The `WeightAdaptor` uses regret scores to down-weight the criteria that led to regret-producing mutations. Over time the fitness function gets calibrated not just on short-term outcomes but on whether mutations age well.

**Why it's novel:** No AI system tracks regret as a feedback signal on its own evaluation criteria. Financial systems do this (backtest decay), but no software evolution system does.

---

### 6. Counterfactual Fitness Simulation

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 90, v9.23.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase90/phase90_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase90/phase90_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/governance/AUDIT_CLOSEOUT_REPORT_2026-03.md](docs/governance/AUDIT_CLOSEOUT_REPORT_2026-03.md#finding-66-003--ip-closure-and-evidence-chain) · Claims: [`phase90-innov06-cepd-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** Before accepting a mutation, simulate what would have happened if the system had *not* made the last 5 accepted mutations, and score the current proposal against that counterfactual baseline.

The idea: the system might be in a local optimum because its recent mutations created it. A mutation that looks mediocre relative to the current state might be excellent relative to the counterfactual state. And a mutation that looks excellent might only look that way because recent mutations opened an artificially easy target.

Uses the existing `BaselineStore` and `LineageLedgerV2` to reconstruct the counterfactual state, then runs the fitness orchestrator on both. Proposals that are only good relative to a potentially inflated baseline get scored more conservatively.

**Why it's novel:** Counterfactual reasoning about your own evolutionary path. This addresses the local optima problem at the governance layer, not just the search layer.

---

### 7. Epistemic Confidence Decay

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 91, v9.24.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase91/phase91_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase91/phase91_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/governance/ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03-v2.md](docs/governance/ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03-v2.md#milestone-history-context) · Claims: [`phase91-innov07-lsme-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** Every fitness signal has a `confidence` value that decays over time as the system state diverges from the state in which the signal was observed.

Currently a fitness weight learned in epoch 10 is applied with the same confidence in epoch 200, even though the system has changed radically. This is like using a map from 10 years ago in a city that's been rebuilt.

`EpistemicDecayEngine`: each weight in the `WeightAdaptor` carries an `observation_state_hash` — the hash of the `CodebaseStateVector` when the weight was last calibrated. As subsequent mutations change the codebase, the divergence between the current `CodebaseStateVector` and the calibration state grows. When divergence exceeds a threshold, that weight's confidence decays and the system increases its exploration rate to recalibrate.

**Why it's novel:** Epistemic humility about learned knowledge. Machine learning systems never forget confidence. This one does — correctly.

---

### 8. Adversarial Fitness Red Team

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 92, v9.25.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase92/phase92_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase92/phase92_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/plans/PHASE_92_PLAN.md](docs/plans/PHASE_92_PLAN.md) · Claims: [`phase92-innov08-afrt-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A dedicated red-team agent whose only job is to try to break any mutation that the main agents propose, specifically looking for edge cases the proposer didn't consider.

The `AdversarialFitnessEngine` already exists and challenges mutations. The Red Team Agent goes further: it receives a mutation proposal and generates up to 5 adversarial test cases specifically designed to fail. It uses the `CodeIntelModel` to find the paths least covered by the proposer's tests, generates inputs designed to exercise those paths, and scores the mutation on whether it handles them.

A mutation accepted by the Red Team Agent has been stress-tested beyond its own test suite. A mutation that fails Red Team review goes back to the proposer with a list of discovered vulnerabilities.

**Why it's novel:** Adversarial red-teaming as a governance gate, not just a QA step. The system actively tries to falsify its own proposals before accepting them.

---

### 9. Aesthetic Fitness Signal
> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 93, v9.26.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase93/phase93_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase93/phase93_sign_off.json) · Closure: [docs/plans/PHASE_93_CLOSURE.md](docs/plans/PHASE_93_CLOSURE.md) · Claims: [`phase93-innov09-afit-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A fitness dimension measuring code readability, naming quality, and structural clarity — not just correctness and performance.

Technical debt is real. A system that only optimizes for test coverage and performance will systematically accumulate cognitive complexity that makes future mutations harder. The `AestheticFitnessScorer` measures:

- Average function length (shorter is better, within reason)
- Variable name entropy (meaningful names vs. single-letter soup)
- Nesting depth reduction over time
- Comment-to-complexity ratio (heavily complex code should have proportionally more comments)
- Cognitive complexity score using the existing `SemanticDiffEngine` cyclomatic metric

Weighted at 5% initially, rises automatically as `EpistemicDecay` reduces confidence in other signals.

**Why it's novel:** No automated system scores code beauty as a first-class fitness signal. This one does, because beauty correlates with long-term maintainability and auditability.

---

## Category III — Memory and Identity

### 10. Morphogenetic Memory

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 94, v9.27.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase94/track_a_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase94/track_a_sign_off.json) · Claims: [`phase94-innov10-mmem-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A persistent architectural identity model — a map of what ADAAD believes its own purpose is, encoded as a queryable structure that every mutation proposal must be consistent with.

The `SoulboundLedger` stores craft patterns. This goes further: it stores the system's self-model — its understanding of its own architectural intentions, its key invariants in plain language, its known failure modes, and its active goals. Every mutation proposal is run against this self-model: "Is this mutation consistent with what this system is trying to be?"

The self-model is not the constitution. The constitution is rules. The self-model is identity. It answers "what are we" not "what are we allowed to do."

Encoded as a hash-chained ledger of `IdentityStatement` entries, each one human-authored and HUMAN-0 gated. The mutation pipeline reads the self-model when assembling LLM proposal context, giving the proposer not just system state but system identity.

**Why it's novel:** Self-model as a first-class architectural component. No AI system has a formally encoded, hash-chained sense of its own identity that it consults before making changes.

---

### 11. Cross-Epoch Dream State

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 96, v9.29.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase96/track_a_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase96/track_a_sign_off.json) · Claims: [`phase96-innov11-dste-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A "dreaming" mode that runs between active evolution epochs, replaying past mutations in novel combinations to discover improvements that weren't available at the time.

Inspired by the neuroscience of memory consolidation during sleep: the brain replays recent experiences in novel combinations, forming connections that weren't apparent during the original experience. ADAAD's dream state takes accepted mutations from the last 100 epochs and runs a combinatorial exploration: what if mutation A and mutation C from different epochs were combined? What if the strategy that worked in epoch 40 was applied to the target that mutation B addressed in epoch 65?

The `DreamStateEngine` runs in the gaps between real epochs, producing `DreamCandidate` objects — hypothetical mutations that combine elements of past successful mutations. The highest-scoring dream candidates enter the proposal queue as seeded candidates for the next real epoch.

**Why it's novel:** Memory replay as a source of novel proposals. Every other AI loop only generates proposals from current system state. This one learns from history by recombining it.

---

### 12. Mutation Genealogy Visualization

> **Status:** ✅ **Shipped** — Phase 97, v9.30.0 · Evidence: [artifacts/governance/phase97/track_a_sign_off.json](artifacts/governance/phase97/track_a_sign_off.json) · Claims: [`phase97-innov12-mgv-shipped` row](docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md)

**What it is:** A living ancestry tree that tracks not just which mutations descended from which, but what properties they inherited, which properties they introduced, and which properties they mutated away from their parents.

The `MultiGenLineageGraph` tracks ancestry. This extends it: each edge in the graph carries a `PropertyInheritanceVector` — which fitness dimensions improved relative to parent, which degraded, which stayed flat. Summing the inheritance vectors along any lineage path shows you the "evolutionary direction" of that branch.

This enables genuinely new analytical capability: find the mutations that consistently produce offspring with improving fitness trends. Find the mutations that are fitness "dead ends" — accepted themselves but rarely producing viable descendants. Preferentially seed proposals from the productive lineages.

**Why it's novel:** Evolutionary fitness tracking at the lineage level, not the individual level. Population genetics applied to software mutation.

---

### 13. Institutional Memory Transfer
**What it is:** A protocol for one ADAAD instance to transfer its `CodebaseKnowledgeGraph` and `SoulboundLedger` to a newly bootstrapped ADAAD instance running on different hardware — preserving learned knowledge across hardware migrations.

Currently an ADAAD instance that moves to new hardware starts learning from scratch. This defines a cryptographically verified knowledge transfer protocol: the exporting instance signs a bundle of its knowledge state, the importing instance verifies the signature, and imports the knowledge while maintaining the chain of custody in the `governance_events.jsonl` ledger.

The knowledge is portable. The hardware is not. The system's accumulated engineering wisdom outlives any particular deployment.

**Why it's novel:** Cryptographically verified knowledge migration. The difference between institutional memory that survives and institutional memory that dies with the server.

---

## Category IV — Multi-Agent Architecture

### 14. Constitutional Jury System
**What it is:** For high-stakes mutations — those touching `runtime/` or `security/` — convene a jury of 3 randomly selected agent instances, each evaluating the proposal independently, with the acceptance decision requiring 2-of-3 agreement.

Currently `GovernanceGate` is a single deterministic evaluator. The jury system introduces genuine deliberation: three independent evaluations, each using a different random seed for their LLM calls, each producing a signed verdict. The final decision is the majority, with the dissenting verdict recorded in the ledger for future learning.

Dissenting verdicts are especially valuable: when one juror rejects what two approved, the rejection reasoning becomes high-priority training signal for the `InvariantDiscoveryEngine`.

**Why it's novel:** Adversarial deliberation architecture for governance decisions. The first software governance system with a formal jury mechanism.

---

### 15. Agent Reputation Staking
**What it is:** Before an agent submits a proposal, it must stake a portion of its `AgentEconomy` credits on the claim that the proposal will pass governance and improve fitness. If the proposal fails governance, the staked credits are burned. If it passes and the fitness improves, the agent earns a reputation multiplier.

This creates genuine skin-in-the-game for every proposal. An agent that consistently proposes mutations it believes will fail — because they're high-entropy exploratory shots — gets penalized. An agent with a history of confident, accurate proposals earns higher proposal authority.

The staking mechanism forces agents to calibrate: how confident am I really? It converts abstract "I think this might work" into concrete resource commitment.

**Why it's novel:** Economic commitment as a quality signal on AI proposals. The first AI system where agents have literal stake in their own suggestions.

---

### 16. Emergent Role Specialization
**What it is:** Rather than assigning roles to agents (architect, dream, beast), let roles *emerge* from observed behavior patterns over time.

New agents start undifferentiated. The `AgentBehaviorClustering` engine watches their proposal distributions: which targets do they prefer, which strategies do they favor, what risk levels do they tend toward. After 50 epochs, clustering reveals the natural roles that have emerged.

An agent that consistently proposes structural simplifications has become an architect — even if it wasn't designed to be. An agent that consistently takes high-risk shots has become a beast. The discovered roles are formalized and rewarded accordingly, but the roles themselves were never programmed.

**Why it's novel:** Spontaneous role emergence in a multi-agent system under selection pressure. This is evolutionary specialization happening in software agents, not organisms.

---

### 17. Agent Post-Mortem Interviews
**What it is:** After any mutation is rejected at governance, the proposing agent is given the rejection reason and asked to generate a plain-language explanation of why it made the proposal it made and what it would do differently.

The explanation is stored in the `KnowledgeGraph` as an `AgentReasoningEntry`. Over time, these entries reveal how each agent thinks — which patterns it over-indexes on, which risks it consistently underestimates, which constitutional rules it most often misses.

The entries are used in two ways: fed back into the proposing agent's context for future proposals ("you made this mistake before"), and used by the `ConstitutionalJury` system to weight agent credibility on specific mutation types.

**Why it's novel:** Explicit agent reasoning capture and retrospective learning. The first AI system that formally debriefs its own agents on their failures.

---

## Category V — Governance Architecture

### 18. Temporal Governance Windows
**What it is:** Constitutional rules that are only active during specific time windows or system states — "governance that knows when to tighten and when to relax."

Some rules should apply more strictly during periods of instability. A rule like `max_consecutive_exploit` that limits exploit mode streaks should be tighter when `health_score < 0.70` and can be looser when `health_score > 0.90`. Currently rules are binary: on or off.

`TemporalGovernanceWindows` defines rules with `activation_conditions` — predicates on system state that must be true for the rule to apply at full blocking severity. Below that threshold, the rule drops to `warning`. Above that threshold, the rule may escalate to `blocking` with tighter parameters.

**Why it's novel:** Responsive governance calibrated to system health. The equivalent of traffic lights that change cycle timing based on congestion — not the same rules all the time, but the right rules for the current state.

---

### 19. Governance Archaeology Mode
**What it is:** A special read-only operating mode that replays the entire governance history of any mutation lineage, showing exactly which rules fired, which thresholds were crossed, which evidence was presented — at any past epoch.

The infrastructure for this exists (deterministic replay, hash-chained ledgers, `ProposalCaptureEvent`). What's missing is a unified interface that answers: "Show me everything that happened to mutation M-0047 from proposal to production, including all governance evaluations, every score, every rule that ran."

`GovernanceArchaeologyMode` assembles this view from the distributed ledgers and presents it as a complete, navigable timeline. Every decision is traceable. Every score is reproducible. Every human signoff is verified against the governance chain.

**Why it's novel:** Full archaeological auditability of an AI system's decisions. Regulators, auditors, and future engineers can examine any decision in the system's entire history with cryptographic certainty that what they're seeing is what actually happened.

---

### 20. Constitutional Stress Testing
**What it is:** A dedicated simulation mode that generates adversarial scenarios specifically designed to stress-test the constitutional framework — finding mutations that would barely pass every rule while violating the spirit of all of them.

The `ConstitutionalStressTester` is an adversarial agent that knows the exact thresholds of all 23 constitutional rules and generates mutations specifically calibrated to pass each one by the minimum margin. Any mutation that passes all rules but scores below 0.20 on human auditability is a constitutional gap.

Findings are reported as `ConstitutionalStressReport` entries: which combination of rule thresholds allowed a potentially problematic mutation through, and what new rule or threshold adjustment would close the gap. These reports are the primary input to the `InvariantDiscoveryEngine`.

**Why it's novel:** Automated adversarial testing of your own governance framework. Red-teaming the constitution, not just the code.

---

### 21. Governance Debt Bankruptcy Protocol
**What it is:** A formal mechanism for when accumulated governance debt becomes systemically disqualifying — triggering a structured "bankruptcy" that pauses mutation activity while the system works through mandatory remediation.

Currently `GovernanceDebtLedger` tracks debt and `GovernanceHealthAggregator` reports degradation. But there's no mechanism for when debt is catastrophic. The Bankruptcy Protocol defines a `GOVERNANCE_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD` beyond which the system enters structured remediation:

1. All new mutation proposals suspended for N epochs
2. `RemediationAgent` activates — only allowed to propose mutations that directly reduce governance debt
3. Human governor receives a structured remediation plan with acceptance criteria
4. Normal operation resumes only when health score returns above `0.60` for 5 consecutive epochs

**Why it's novel:** Structured remediation with formal exit criteria. Corporate bankruptcy law applied to AI governance. The first AI system with a formal insolvency mechanism for its own governance health.

---

## Category VI — Real-World Integration

### 22. Market-Conditioned Fitness
**What it is:** Real-time connection between fitness scores and external signals — GitHub star velocity, API call rates, error rates in production, benchmark scores against published competitors — feeding into the `MarketFitnessIntegrator` which already exists but reads simulated signals.

Wire `MarketFitnessIntegrator` to real feeds: GitHub API for star/fork velocity, HuggingFace leaderboard positions for relevant benchmarks, Anthropic API latency data if available. A mutation that improves internal scores but correlates with external metric degradation gets a fitness penalty. A mutation that correlates with external improvement gets a bonus.

The fitness function becomes anchored to real-world impact, not just internal metrics.

**Why it's novel:** The first AI evolution system where fitness is partially grounded in external market validation, not purely internal evaluation. The system cares whether the real world notices.

---

### 23. Regulatory Compliance Layer
**What it is:** A constitutional rule set specifically encoding emerging AI regulation requirements — EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, emerging US federal AI standards — as enforceable governance gates.

`ComplianceRuleEngine`: a specialized rule evaluator that sits alongside the existing constitution and evaluates each mutation against a versioned compliance rule set. Rules in this set are tagged with their regulatory source, their enforcement date, and their jurisdiction. A mutation that would introduce behavior violating GDPR data minimization (logged personal data without retention limits) gets blocked with a compliance citation.

The compliance rule set is updated through the `ConstitutionalAmendmentEngine` as regulations evolve, with `HUMAN-0` required for every update.

**Why it's novel:** The first AI system with governance gates encoding external regulatory requirements as machine-enforceable rules. Compliance-by-design rather than compliance-by-audit.

---

### 24. Semantic Version Promises
**What it is:** Formal, machine-verifiable promises about what semantic version boundary a mutation crosses — and automatic blocking if the actual change contradicts the stated promise.

Currently `VERSION` is bumped manually. This proposal: every mutation proposal declares `version_impact: patch | minor | major`. The `SemanticVersionVerifier` validates this claim: a mutation declaring `patch` that actually changes a public API signature gets blocked. A mutation declaring `minor` that actually breaks backwards compatibility gets blocked.

Semantic versioning becomes an enforceable contract, not a convention.

**Why it's novel:** Machine enforcement of semantic versioning promises. The ecosystem of downstream consumers can trust that a version bump means what it says because the governance gate verified it.

### 25. Hardware-Adaptive Fitness
**What it is:** Fitness scores that are relative to the hardware profile of the target deployment — a mutation that improves performance on ARM (Android device) but hurts performance on x86 should score differently depending on which device it's being deployed to.

The `AndroidMonitor` already tracks device resources. Extend this: the fitness orchestrator receives a `HardwareProfile` (CPU architecture, RAM limit, battery constraints, thermal envelope) and adjusts scoring weights accordingly. A mutation on a memory-constrained device scores `efficiency_score` at 3x normal weight. A mutation on a server scores `correctness_score` at 3x.

ADAAD doesn't just evolve good code. It evolves code that is good *for the hardware it runs on*.

**Why it's novel:** Hardware-relative fitness. No AI code evolution system adapts its fitness function to the deployment target. This one does.

## Category VII — Safety and Alignment

### 26. Constitutional Entropy Budget
**What it is:** A hard limit on how much the constitution itself can change per epoch-window — preventing rapid constitutional drift even when each individual change passes `HUMAN-0`.

If each amendment changes 2% of the constitutional rules and amendments happen every 10 epochs, the constitution has fully replaced itself within 50 epochs. No single amendment triggers concern but the cumulative effect is constitutional replacement.

`ConstitutionalEntropyBudget`: measures the Hamming distance between the current constitution and the genesis constitution. When the distance exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30% of rules modified from genesis), further amendments require double-`HUMAN-0` — two separate human signoff events with a mandatory 10-epoch cooling period between them.

**Why it's novel:** Rate-limiting constitutional change at the systemic level. The first formal defense against "boiling frog" constitutional drift in an AI system.

### 27. Mutation Blast Radius Modeling
**What it is:** Before accepting any mutation, compute a `BlastRadiusModel` — a formal estimate of how many other modules would break, degrade, or need updating if this mutation were reverted.

A mutation with a small blast radius (only one module depends on the changed interface) is low-risk to accept. A mutation with a large blast radius (changing a function called from 47 other modules) carries higher reversal cost even if it's a good change.

Blast radius becomes a governance input: high-blast-radius mutations require additional evidence of correctness, get longer replay verification periods, and are automatically scheduled for earlier review in the next `GovernanceArchaeologyMode` audit.

**Why it's novel:** Formal reversal cost modeling as a governance input. No system currently reasons about how hard it would be to undo a change before deciding to make it.

---

### 28. Self-Awareness Invariant
**What it is:** A constitutional rule that specifically prevents the system from generating mutations that would impair its own ability to introspect, monitor, or audit itself.

`SELF-AWARE-0`: No mutation may reduce the observability surface of `runtime/metrics.py`, `runtime/invariants.py`, `security/ledger/journal.py`, or any other module in the system's self-monitoring infrastructure. A mutation that removes a `metrics.log()` call, reduces invariant check coverage, or simplifies an audit trail is constitutionally blocked.

The system is allowed to improve itself. It is not allowed to make itself harder to watch while doing so.

**Why it's novel:** Self-monitoring as a constitutional right. An AI system that formally protects its own transparency infrastructure from optimization pressure. Most systems optimize away their own monitoring under performance pressure. This one constitutionally cannot.

---

### 29. Curiosity-Driven Exploration with Hard Stops
**What it is:** A structured curiosity budget — dedicated exploration cycles where the fitness function is intentionally inverted to reward *unusual* mutations, bounded by hard constitutional stops.

Standard evolution is exploitation-heavy: it converges on what has worked. `CuriosityEngine`: every 25 epochs, allocate 3 epochs to inverted-fitness exploration where the scoring function rewards divergence from the current optimum. The `FailurePatternMiner` specifically watches these epochs to find novel failure modes — things the system didn't know it couldn't do.

Hard stops: if any curiosity-epoch mutation touches constitutional enforcement code, `HUMAN-0` fires. If any curiosity-epoch mutation degrades `health_score` below `0.50`, curiosity mode exits immediately. The budget for curiosity is real but bounded.

**Why it's novel:** Formalized, bounded, constitutionally contained curiosity. The distinction between "free to explore" and "free to break everything" enforced at the governance layer.

---

### 30. The Mirror Test
**What it is:** Periodic evaluation of whether ADAAD can correctly predict its own governance decisions — given a mutation proposal, can it accurately predict which constitutional rules will fire and why? A system that has genuinely learned its own governance will score high. A system that is just guessing will score low.

`MirrorTestEngine`: every 50 epochs, present the system with 20 historical mutation proposals (with outcomes redacted) and ask it to predict: which rules fired, did this pass or fail governance, what was the fitness score? The `prediction_accuracy` field already exists on `WeightAdaptor`. This extends it to governance prediction.

Low mirror test scores trigger a `ConstitutionalCalibrationEpoch` — a dedicated phase where the system studies its own governance history and rebuilds its internal model of its own rules before resuming active mutation.

**Why it's novel:** Self-knowledge as a measurable, benchmarked property of an AI system. The question "does this system actually understand its own rules?" becomes answerable, testable, and tracked over time.

## Implementation Priority Stack

> **Governance note:** This ranking is **strategic prioritization only**. It does **not** authorize execution order changes and cannot override predecessor/phase sequence gates defined in `docs/governance/ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03-v2.md`.
>
> **Operational lock:** Execution remains phase-locked. Current shipped milestone is **Phase 97**; next executable item is **Phase 98 / INNOV-13**. Any out-of-order implementation requires an explicit governance amendment before work begins.

| Priority | Innovation | Why First |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **30 — Mirror Test** | Immediately measurable from existing data |
| 2 | **1 — Invariant Discovery Engine** | Uses `FailurePatternMiner` already built |
| 3 | **5 — Temporal Regret Scorer** | Uses `BaselineStore` + existing fitness pipeline |
| 4 | **28 — Self-Awareness Invariant** | One constitutional rule addition, massive safety gain |
| 5 | **11 — Cross-Epoch Dream State** | Uses `EpochMemoryStore` + `LineageLedgerV2` already built |
| 6 | **26 — Constitutional Entropy Budget** | Amendment frequency tracking, measurable today |
| 7 | **10 — Morphogenetic Memory** | Extends `SoulboundLedger` + `KnowledgeGraph` |
| 8 | **15 — Agent Reputation Staking** | Extends existing `AgentEconomy` module |
| 9 | **7 — Epistemic Confidence Decay** | Extends `WeightAdaptor` + `CodebaseStateVector` |
| 10 | **14 — Constitutional Jury System** | Extends `GovernanceGate` multi-instance |

## The Singular Claim

Any one of these would be publishable research. All thirty together describe a system that is not just better than any existing AI evolution loop — it is operating in a different conceptual space entirely.

The difference: every other AI loop asks "what change makes this better right now?"

ADAAD with these additions asks: "what change makes this better now, ages well, doesn't contradict itself, earns the trust of human oversight, and leaves the system in a state that future changes can be made safely?"

That is not a better gradient descent. That is a different kind of intelligence.
