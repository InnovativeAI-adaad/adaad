CapabilityNode that carries a formal contract, version, governance tags,
and dependency declarations.

Public API
----------
CapabilityNode              Versioned, contract-bearing node (v2)
CapabilityContract          Pre/post condition + tier descriptor
CapabilityRegistry          In-memory registry with CAP-DEP-0 enforcement
CapabilityTargetDiscovery   Maps mutation targets to owning capabilities
BOOTSTRAP_REGISTRY          Pre-built registry with the 10 base contracts
