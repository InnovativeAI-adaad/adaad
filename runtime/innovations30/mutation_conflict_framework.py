"""Innovation #22 — Mutation Conflict Framework (MCF).

When two concurrent mutations target overlapping code regions, the MCF
detects the conflict, classifies severity, routes to auto-resolution or
HUMAN-0 escalation, and maintains a chain-linked tamper-evident ledger of
every conflict event.

Constitutional invariants enforced by this module
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
MCF-0           MCF_VERSION must be present and non-empty; asserted at import.
MCF-DETECT-0    A conflict is detected iff two mutations share at least one
                target_path segment; detection is deterministic — overlap is
                computed as the intersection of two sorted frozensets.
MCF-SEVERITY-0  Conflict severity must be one of "low" | "medium" | "high" |
                "critical"; any other value raises MCFViolation at classify().
MCF-PERSIST-0   Every ConflictRecord is appended to an append-only JSONL
                ledger; the file is opened exclusively in "a" mode; no record
                may be deleted or overwritten.
MCF-CHAIN-0     Each ledger entry carries prev_digest referencing the digest
                of the preceding entry (first entry uses prev_digest="genesis");
                the chain can be replayed to detect tampering via hmac.compare_digest.
MCF-RESOLVE-0   Auto-resolution requires severity in ("low", "medium"); severity
                "high" or "critical" must escalate to HUMAN-0 advisory before
                any resolution is recorded; MCFViolation raised otherwise.
MCF-GATE-0      analyze() raises MCFViolation when called with a blank mutation_id
                for either input — blank-id bypass is a constitutional violation.
MCF-DETERM-0    conflict_digest = sha256(sorted(mutation_ids) + sorted(overlap_paths));
                deterministic across all runtime environments.
