runtime.mutation.ast_substrate — AST Mutation Substrate (Phase 60)
===================================================================
The Motor layer of ADAAD v8.  Provides the primitive pipeline for
governed code mutation:

  ASTDiffPatch          The DNA: hash-verifiable mutation primitive.
  StaticSafetyScanner   Gates patches with 4 constitutional rules.
  PatchApplicator       LibCST-based application with SANDBOX-DIV-0 guard.
  SandboxTournament     Ephemeral candidate competition; always sandbox-only.

Invariants
----------
SANDBOX-DIV-0  before/after AST hashes must match after apply; auto-rollback.
PATCH-SIZE-0   max 40 delta AST nodes, max 2 files.
TIER0-SELF-0   Tier-0 bound modules blocked by CapabilityTargetDiscovery upstream.
MUTATION_SANDBOX_ONLY=true enforced during stabilisation (all Phase 60 work).
