# ADAAD Trust Center

**v9.48.0 · Phase 115 · 30 Innovations Complete · 125 Hard-class Invariants**

This Trust Center provides a buyer-facing overview of ADAAD governance, security, independent verification pathways, and operational assurance artifacts. It addresses the five questions enterprise procurement teams ask first.

---

## I. What ADAAD Is

ADAAD is a constitutionally governed autonomous code evolution runtime — not a code assistant, not CI/CD, but a system that proposes mutations to its own source code, adversarially stress-tests them, scores them against constitutional rules, runs them in a zero-write shadow harness, checks them against a formally encoded self-model, and requires cryptographic sign-off before anything critical ships — with every decision sealed in a tamper-evident hash-chained ledger.

The governance stack is not a policy layer. It is the only promotion path. There is no bypass, no override flag, no configuration that changes this.

## II. Core Assurance Properties

| Property | Implementation | Invariant | Independent verifiable? |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Tamper-evident ledger | SHA-256 hash-chained append-only JSONL | `CEL-EVIDENCE-0` | ✅ Yes — any hash break is immediately detectable |
| Deterministic replay | No `datetime.now()` / `random()` in constitutional paths; `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` | `CEL-REPLAY-0` | ✅ Yes — any prior epoch reproducible from inputs |
| Step ordering enforcement | Runtime sequence check — out-of-order aborts epoch | `CEL-ORDER-0` | ✅ Yes — enforced in `constitutional_evolution_loop.py` |
| Human authority is structural | GPG key required for Tier 0 — not a configuration option | `HUMAN-0` | ✅ Yes — architecturally enforced, not policy |
| Red Team cannot approve | Structurally incapable — PASS or RETURNED only | `AFRT-0` | ✅ Yes — enforced in `afrt_engine.py` |
| Zero-write shadow harness | Write or egress = hard block, not warning | `LSME-0` | ✅ Yes — enforced in `lsme_engine.py` |
| Boot completeness gate | RuntimeError if any of 30 innovations fail to import | `INNOV-COMPLETE-0` | ✅ Yes — `from runtime.innovations30 import boot_completeness_check` |
| Constitutional jury gate | 2-of-3 approval required for high-stakes paths | `CJS-QUORUM-0` | ✅ Yes — `constitutional_jury.py` |
| Governance drift cap | 30% rule-change threshold triggers double-HUMAN-0 | `CEB-0` | ✅ Yes — `constitutional_entropy_budget.py` |
| Self-monitoring protection | No mutation may reduce observability | `SELF-AWARE-0` | ✅ Yes — `self_awareness_invariant.py` |

## III. Independent Verification — The Phase 65 Self-Evolution Event

**This is the most important claim in ADAAD's history.** On March 13, 2026, ADAAD identified its own highest-priority capability gap, generated a mutation, ran a sandboxed fitness tournament, scored it against constitutional rules, applied it, and sealed the proof in the ledger — with zero human intervention in the execution path.

Every part of this event is independently reproducible. An auditor does not need special access, credentials, or system knowledge beyond this repository.

### How to independently verify Phase 65

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/adaad.git
cd adaad

# 2. Set deterministic environment — required for byte-identical replay
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
export ADAAD_SEED=42
export PYTHONHASHSEED=0

# 3. Replay the Phase 65 founding event in strict mode
python -m app.main --replay strict --epoch-id phase65-emergence-001 --verbose

# Expected output:
#   epoch_id         : phase65-emergence-001
#   evidence_hash    : <sha256 — must match ledger entry>
#   mutations_applied: 1
#   governance_decision: APPROVED
#   replay_verified  : true

# 4. Cross-check against the ledger entry
python -c "
import json
events = [json.loads(l) for l in open('security/ledger/scoring.jsonl')]
phase65 = [e for e in events if e.get('epoch_id') == 'phase65-emergence-001']
print('Ledger entry found:', len(phase65) > 0)
print('Evidence hash:', phase65[0]['evidence_hash'] if phase65 else 'NOT FOUND')
"
```

**What divergence means:** If the replay produces a different evidence hash, it means the environment differs from the one used during the original epoch — not that the claim is false. Check: Python minor version, `PYTHONHASHSEED`, dependency versions. A genuine tamper event would break the hash chain of every subsequent ledger entry.

### Verify the hash chain integrity

```bash
python -c "
from runtime.lineage.lineage_ledger_v2 import LineageLedgerV2
ledger = LineageLedgerV2()
result = ledger.verify_chain()
print('Chain valid:', result)
print('Events:', len(ledger.events()))
# False means at least one entry has been altered — the specific broken link is reported
"
```

### Third-party audit engagement

ADAAD is actively seeking a named independent third-party auditor to publicly attest the Phase 65 self-evolution event. The replay instructions above are the complete specification for what that audit entails. No proprietary access, bespoke tooling, or NDA is required.

## IV. Versioning Rationale

**A direct answer to the "39 minor increments in 20 days" question.**

ADAAD uses a **phase-correlated version scheme** by design. Each minor increment in the `v9.x.0` series corresponds to one shipped, HUMAN-0-attested, evidence-linked governance phase — not a traditional semver backward-compatible feature addition.

`v9.48.0` means 48 governed phase milestones have shipped in the v9 series. Each phase has:
- A governance ledger event with `session_digest` sign-off
- 30 passing acceptance tests named `T<N>-<MODULE>-01..30`
- A CHANGELOG entry with evidence references
- A four-file canonical version sync (`VERSION` · `pyproject.toml` · `CHANGELOG.md` · `.adaad_agent_state.json`)
- A HUMAN-0 `human0_signoffs` record in `.adaad_agent_state.json`

**What this means for an evaluator:** The version number is an audit counter. `v9.48.0` does not mean "48 API features were added" — it means "48 times, a human governor reviewed, signed off, and merged a governed, tested, cryptographically attested phase into main." The density signals governance discipline, not version inflation.

**Why AI-assisted development enables this cadence:** ADAAD is simultaneously the tool being built and the primary evidence for the value proposition it's claiming. One person building a constitutionally governed autonomous code evolution system in 12 weeks is itself the existence proof that the system works. The timeline is not suspicious — it is the thesis.

---

## V. Key-Person Concentration — Honest Disclosure

**The critical risk, stated plainly.**

ADAAD is effectively built by one person: Dustin L. Reid, Governor, Innovative AI LLC, Blackwell, Oklahoma. He holds the HUMAN-0 GPG key (`4C95E2F99A775335B1CF3DAF247B015A1CCD95F6`), which is required to sign all Tier 0 governance events and release tags. No Tier 0 mutation can be promoted without his signature. This is simultaneously the project's greatest vulnerability and its clearest governance proof point.

**Mitigation path:**

1. **FINDING-66-004 — Ed25519 2-of-3 key ceremony (P3, runbook delivered):** The governance architecture already specifies a 2-of-3 Ed25519 threshold key ceremony (`FINDING-66-004`, status: `runbook_delivered`). Execution of this ceremony distributes Tier 0 authority across 3 key holders, eliminating single-point-of-failure on the governor key. This is the next critical human-action item.

2. **Open source mitigates bus factor:** The constitutional framework, invariant enforcement, ledger architecture, and all 30 innovations are fully open source under Apache 2.0. Any competent Python engineer can audit, fork, and operate the system from the public repository.

3. **The ledger is portable:** Every governance decision is in append-only JSONL files in the repository. The audit trail survives any organizational change.

4. **The constitution governs succession:** Constitutional amendments (INNOV-01 CSAP) require HUMAN-0 ratification. A succession governance protocol can be encoded as a constitutional amendment under the same process used for all other amendments.

**For enterprise procurement:** The honest answer is that key-person concentration at the current stage is a real risk factor. The runbook for the 2-of-3 key ceremony has been delivered. The mitigating factors — open source, portable ledger, constitutional succession protocol — reduce but do not eliminate this risk until the key ceremony is executed.

---

## VI. GA Blocker — Current Status

The active GA blocker is **FINDING-66-004: 2-of-3 Ed25519 key ceremony** (status: `runbook_delivered`, P3 severity).

This is intentionally transparent. ADAAD is not claiming false GA readiness. The finding requires Dustin L. Reid (HUMAN-0) to execute a physical key ceremony with two additional key holders. This is a human-in-the-loop action that cannot be automated or delegated.

All other previously tracked GA blockers (FINDING-66-001 through FINDING-66-005) are resolved. The single remaining blocker is explicitly documented, has a runbook, and is tracked in `.adaad_agent_state.json`.

---

## VII. Constitutional Invariants — Verified vs. Self-Asserted

**The most important technical question for any serious evaluator.**

The cold claim "125 Hard-class invariants enforced at runtime" must be distinguished from policy-layer enforcement that can be bypassed.

ADAAD's Hard-class invariants are **structural** — they are embedded in the execution flow, not asserted in a verify step that could be skipped. A violation causes epoch abort via a typed exception (`GateViolation` subclass). They cannot be configured away, feature-flagged off, or bypassed by callers.

**How to verify this claim independently:**

```bash
# Check invariant enforcement structure for a specific invariant
python -c "
import ast, pathlib
src = pathlib.Path('runtime/innovations30/constitutional_jury.py').read_text()
tree = ast.parse(src)
# Look for: typed exception class, invariant constants, raise statements
classes = [n.name for n in ast.walk(tree) if isinstance(n, ast.ClassDef)]
raises = [n for n in ast.walk(tree) if isinstance(n, ast.Raise)]
print('Exception classes:', [c for c in classes if 'Error' in c or 'Violation' in c])
print('Raise statements:', len(raises))
"

# Verify that CJS-0 cannot be bypassed by checking it raises on violation
python -c "
from runtime.innovations30.constitutional_jury import (
    ConstitutionalJury, ConstitutionalJuryConfigError
)
try:
    # jury_size < JURY_SIZE must raise, not silently degrade
    j = ConstitutionalJury(jury_size=1)
    print('FAIL: should have raised')
except ConstitutionalJuryConfigError as e:
    print('PASS: CJS-QUORUM-0 enforced -', str(e)[:60])
"
```

**The invariant constant block pattern:** Every constitutionally hardened module contains a module-header invariant constant block — named string constants like `JURY_SIZE: int = 3` — that make the enforcement surface auditable by static analysis without executing the code.

---

## VIII. External Adoption — Current Status and Path

**Honest current state:** 0 dependent packages. The project is pre-community as of April 2026. The only consumer of the system is the system itself.

**Why this is the expected state and what changes it:**

ADAAD occupies a space that is genuinely empty: constitutionally governed autonomous code evolution with cryptographic provenance. Empty spaces are empty because demand hasn't reached scale yet — not necessarily because no one built it. The EU AI Act, US executive orders on AI, and enterprise risk teams waking up to AI provenance requirements are the regulatory tailwinds that create the demand.

The path from 0 dependents to meaningful adoption has one critical first step: **one named enterprise pilot**. A single identified organization running ADAAD's governance framework against their own AI code evolution pipeline transforms the evidentiary basis entirely — from "a project that claims these properties about itself" to "a framework that has been verified to enforce these properties in a named production context."
